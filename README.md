# liChat
Lightweight chat client

Lightweight implementation of an IRC chat client in C with standard network sockets.

Uses ncurses for a better terminal user interface and scrolling support.

Uses a lightweight centralized server that handles client connections, and message forwarding and broadcasting.

Next steps:

*SSL support 

*P2P messaging after chatroom setup. O(n) threads/queues for each client
